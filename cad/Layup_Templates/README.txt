These are layup size templates for the multiple layers involved in a module layup. These were created to assist in cutting the appropriate carbon fiber and nomex layers for modules B and C. The naming convention follows T-X-YY, where T stands for template, X is the module type (currently B or C), and YY follows 
	Inner carbon fiber layer - IC
	Nomex - NO
	Average of two outer carbon fiber layers - OC
